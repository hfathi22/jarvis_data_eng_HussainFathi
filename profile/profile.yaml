summary: I am a recent Electrical and Biomedical Engineering graduate from McMaster University. I'm currently working
  as a Data Engineer at Jarvis Consulting, taking part in multiple projects such as the Linux Cluster Usage Administration,
  Java Grepp and Java Twitter apps. In addition to Jarvis, I'm also currently working as a Software Engineer at a startup company based in Toronto. My role is centered around designing, developing, and testing an enterprise-level platform targeted towards helping international startup companies to enter the North American markets.
  Throughout my undergraduate career, I have completed 16 months worth of internship experiences in
  the fields of Machine Learning and Software development at the Department of National Defence in Ottawa and
  Adlib Software. I'm really passionate about computer science because it can also be employed in our daily lives.

    description: "Designed, developed, and tested a Linux cluster usage administration agent that allows the user to analyze the usage data of different machines that are connected together through a network switch. A PSQL
    docker container was employed in this project in order to store the machine's usage and hardware data that are obtained by executing two different bash scripts. Crontab was used to retrieve the machine's usage data every one minute and insert it into the PostgreSQL database. Finally, multiple SQL queries can be executed to analyze the data."
