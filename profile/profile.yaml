# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am a recent Electrical and Biomedical Engineering graduate from McMaster University. I'm currently working
  as a Software and Data Engineer at Jarvis Consulting, taking part in multiple projects such as the Linux Cluster Usage Administration,
  Java Grep and Java Twitter apps. In addition to Jarvis, I'm also currently working as a Software Engineer at a startup company based in Toronto. My role is centered around employing MEAN stack technologies to design, develop, and test an enterprise-level platform targeted towards helping international startup companies to enter the North American markets.
  Throughout my undergraduate career, I have completed 16 months worth of internship experiences in
  the fields of Machine Learning and Software development at the Department of National Defence in Ottawa and
  Adlib Software. During my internships, I had the chance to utilize various technologies such as python ML libraries, MATLAB and the .NET Framework. I'm really passionate about computer science because it introduces a way of thinking that can be used to address
  specific problems we're facing in our daily lives.

    description: "Designed, developed, and tested a Linux cluster usage administration agent that allows the user to analyze the usage data of different Linux machines connected together through a network switch. A PSQL
    docker container was employed in this project to store the machine's usage and hardware data that are obtained by executing two different bash scripts. Crontab was used to automate the data acquisition and the database insertion process of the usage data. Finally, multiple SQL queries can be executed to analyze the data."

    git_url: "/core_java"
    description:
      - "**Grep App**: Developed a Java application that searches through all the files in a given directory and outputs a text file containing all the lines matching a given regex pattern. The project employed Maven as the project management tool as well as Java Stream APIs for efficient memory usage. The app is available on DockerHub and can be deployed using Docker."

      - "**JDBC App**: Utilized the JDBC API to connect the Java program with a PostgreSQL database. Data Access Object (DAO) was used to perform CRUD operations on the data. The application was built using Java with IntelliJ IDEA as the IDE along with Maven as the project management tool"

      - "**Twitter App**: Developed a Twitter CLI that allows the user to CRD (Create, Read and Delete) tweets through the command line by calling the Twitter REST API. The application was developed in Java and structured using Maven and Springboot. Packaged using Docker and can be obtained from DockerHub."
  - name: "Hadoop"
    git_url: "/hadoop"
    description: "In this project, the World Development Indicators (WDI) dataset was processed and analyzed using Apache Hadoop. Built using Hadoop and Hive. Hadoop cluster was provisioned using Google Cloud Platform (GCP). All queries and results were save to a Zeppelin notebook."
