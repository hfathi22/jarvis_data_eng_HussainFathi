# Hussain Fathi . Jarvis Consulting

I am a recent Electrical and Biomedical Engineering graduate from McMaster University. I'm currently working as a Data Engineer at Jarvis Consulting, taking part in multiple projects such as the Linux Cluster Usage Administration, Java Grepp and Java Twitter apps. In addition to Jarvis, I'm also currently working as a Software Engineer at a startup company based in Toronto. My role is centered around designing, developing and testing an enterprise level platform targeted towards helping international startup companies to enter the North American markets. Throughout my undergraduate career, I have completed 16 months worth of internship experiences in the fields of Machine Learning and Software development at the Department of National Defence in Ottawa and Adlib Software. I'm really passionate about computer science because it can also be employed in our daily lives as it introduces a different way of thinking about certain aspects of life.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_demo](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_demo)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_demo/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Designed, developed and tested a Linux cluster usage administration agent that allows the user to analyze the usage data of different machines that are connected together through a network switch. A PSQL docker container was employed in this project in order to store the machine's usage and hardwate data that are obtained by executing two different bash scripts. Crontab was used to retrieve the machine's usage data every one minute and inserting it into the PostgreSQL database. Finally, multiple SQL queries can be executed to analyze the data.
